## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# 1

data <- read.csv("대미환율.csv")
return <- diff(log(data$Pt)) # return 데이터 만들기
mean(return) # return 평균
var(return)   # return 분산

data1 <- merge( data, return)   # 시도표

acf(return, 25, main = "ACF") # ACF 
pacf(return, 25, main = "PACF") # PACF


# 2 

set.seed(1); n=500;
phi=0.8
a = rnorm(n)
y=c()
y[1]=0
for (t in 2:n) {
  y[t] = phi * y[t-1] + a[t] }

mean(y)
var(y)

set.seed(1); n=500; M=200;
rho.1=c(); phi=0.0
for (i in 1:M) {
  a = rnorm(n)
  y=c()
  y[1]=0
  for (t in 2:n) {
    y[t] = phi * y[t-1] + a[t] }
  rho.1[i]=acf(y, plot=FALSE)$acf[2]
  #rho^_1
}
plot(rho.1, type = "o")
mean(rho.1);sd(rho.1)
phi=0.8
mean(rho.1)
sd(rho.1)
rho.1[1]


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
